# Design and Fabrication of Tool Organizers using Digital Manufacturing

  ## 📖About The Projec

 This project is part of anacademic endeavor aimed at applying theoretical knowledge in the field ofComputer-Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM). The project focuses ondesigning and producing a series of custom tool organizers using both 3DPrinting and Laser Cutting technologies to efficiently organize workspace andarrange tools. The project involvedfabricating organizers for:
 Hair Dryer  
 Staple
 Toolbox  
 Caliper
 Tape Measure and Ruler 

 🎯 Mission & Objective
 
 The primary goal was tobridge theoretical knowledge in design software (like SolidWorks) with thepractical operation of digital fabrication machines (3D Printer and LaserCutter) to create tangible, organizational solutions that address specificneeds.
## ⚙Components & Tools 
### Software:*  
 SolidWorks: For  designing the organizers.
 *   PrusaSlicer: For converting STL files intoG-Code for printing
.*   CorelDRAW: For preparing files for lasercutting.

 2.Manufacturing Prep (CAM): Designs wereconverted into machine-suitable formats: 
*For 3D Printing: STL -> G-Code using PrusaSlicer.   
* For Laser Cutting: DXF -> Cutting setup in CorelDRAW.


* 3. Fabrication:   
*  Printing parts using the 3D Printer.  
*  Cutting toolbox parts using the Laser Cutter.
